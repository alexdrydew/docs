# field.media-file

Adds buttons for different types of uploads: uploading photos or videos, selecting files from the file manager or choosing from the gallery. In the `accept` property, select which buttons you need.

By default, only one file can be uploaded, but you can allow multiple files in the `multiple` property.

This component is convenient when using mobile devices. To upload files from a computer, it's better to use [field.file](field.file.md) for a more flexible configuration of the file types.

In the task review mode, the uploaded images will appear automatically. You can view, rotate, and switch among the images.

[View example in the sandbox](https://clck.ru/asSVc).

## Using the Toloka mobile app

In the Toloka mobile app, the photo and video buttons open the camera, and the gallery and file manager buttons open the corresponding apps.

After a Toloker submits the task, the files are saved in the app and gradually uploaded to Toloka when there's a Wi-Fi connection. While there's no connection, the task status remains "Submitting via Wi-Fi".
